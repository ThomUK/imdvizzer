The "Core 20" populations in the ICB are highlighted red in the map below.

The core 20 population is the most deprived 20% of the national population as identified by the national [Index of multiple deprivation (IMD)](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019).

The 7 domains of deprivation included in the IMD are below, with their weightings:
